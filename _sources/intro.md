# Make With Machine Learning!

You're probably aware that modern ML research is moving at a break-neck pace right now. 

What you might not realize is that a significant reason for this is cultural: machine learning researchers 
have adopted a lot of the ideology of the open-source community and are constantly feeding back into it. In 
addition to open publication of cutting-edge research, journal articles are often accompanied or even preceded by 
publication of open-sourced code demonstrating the work. This code is often rough around the edges, but increasingly
cutting edge research is being made available as components of easy-to-use libraries and tools.

There are already loads of excellent, free resources available for learning the theory and application of modern machine learning methods.
This book is not one of them. If you want to learn how to build cutting edge machine learning models from scratch, you've come to the wrong place. 

The purpose of this book is to serve as an entrypoint to tooling and models that despite representing the bleeding edge of machine learning 
capabilities, are acceessible to everyone. So who is "everyone?" 

You just need to know enough to be dangerous.

For the most part, the only real pre-requisite here is maybe some basic python programming. I might occassionally use language that I don't explain, but I will at least make an effort to point you in the direction to fill in any knowledge gaps you may have that you want to explore more deeply. I'm not here to teach you fundamentals or survey graduate material. I'm here to show you how easy it is to stand on the shoulders of giants, and hopefully stir you're curiosity.

Enough disclaimers, let's have some fun!
